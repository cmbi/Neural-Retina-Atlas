# Neural-Retina-Atlas

This repository contains the scripts used for the paper 'A proteogenomic atlas of the human neural retina'(link)

## Data
Raw PacBio Iso-Seq data are available at the  European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under accession number x. The mass-spectromety proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE​​ partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD045187. Intermediate files generated during the analysis can be downloaded from Zenodo (link)

THe processed data is available as UCSC genome browser track (link) and as visual database (link).

## Scripts

- [Figures and Tables](figures_and_tables) contains scripts used to create the figures and tables
- [Proteomic](proteomics) contains all scripts used for the proteogenomic analysis
- [Transcriptomics](transcriptomics) contains all scripts for the Iso-Seq analysis
- [Data](data) can be used to store the downloaded data from Zenodo to rerun the scripts
