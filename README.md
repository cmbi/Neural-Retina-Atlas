# Neural-Retina-Atlas

This repository contains the scripts used for the paper 'A proteogenomic atlas of the human neural retina'(link)

## Data
Raw PacBio Iso-Seq data are available at the  European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under accession number x. The mass-spectromety proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE​​ partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD045187. Intermediate files generated during the analysis can be downloaded from Zenodo (link)

The processed data is available as UCSC genome browser track (link).
